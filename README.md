The solution I've provided creates an MCP (Message Control Program) server that connects your Oracle database with natural language processing capabilities. This allows users to query your Oracle database using plain English instead of SQL.

## **How the System Works**

1. **Backend Server**: A FastAPI application that:  
   * Connects to your Oracle database  
   * Processes natural language queries  
   * Translates queries to SQL when appropriate  
   * Returns formatted responses  
2. **Frontend Client**: A simple HTML/CSS/JS interface that:  
   * Displays database schema information  
   * Provides a chat interface for users to ask questions  
   * Shows both the natural language response and underlying SQL  
3. **Architecture Overview**:  
   * User submits a natural language query  
   * System determines if it's a database-related question  
   * If yes, it generates SQL using Claude  
   * Executes the SQL against your Oracle database  
   * Processes results to provide a natural language response

## **Key Features**

* **Schema Exploration**: Users can browse available tables and columns  
* **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in plain English  
* **SQL Transparency**: See the SQL that was generated behind the scenes  
* **Fallback Handling**: Gracefully handles queries that can't be translated to SQL  
* **API Documentation**: Built-in FastAPI docs at `/docs` endpoint

## **Setup Instructions**

1. **Install Dependencies**:  
   * Use the provided `requirements.txt` file to install Python dependencies  
   * Set up Oracle Instant Client (included in Docker setup)  
2. **Configure Environment**:  
   * Update the `.env` file with your Oracle connection details and Anthropic API key  
3. **Start the Server**:  
   * Using Docker: `docker-compose up -d`  
   * Without Docker: `python app.py`  
4. **Access the Frontend**:  
   * Open your browser to `http://localhost:80` (or directly use `frontend_client.html`)

## **Example Queries**

Your users can ask questions like:

* "How many users are registered in our system?"  
* "Show me the top 5 customers by order value"  
* "What were the sales figures for last month?"  
* "Which products have the lowest inventory levels?"

## **Technical Implementation Details**

1. **Oracle Connection**:  
   * Uses cx\_Oracle to connect to your database  
   * Provides methods for executing queries and exploring schema  
2. **Natural Language Processing**:  
   * Uses Claude to analyze natural language queries  
   * Determines if the query is database-related  
   * Generates SQL when appropriate  
3. **Frontend Implementation**:  
   * Simple, responsive interface built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript  
   * No external libraries required  
4. **Security Considerations**:  
   * All database access is through parameterized queries  
   * Input validation at API endpoints  
   * Environment variables
